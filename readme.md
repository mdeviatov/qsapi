# qsapi
## Description
The goal of this project is to integrate Qlik Sense Apps into version control.

qlik_explore.py discovers all applications on a Qlik Sense instance. 
For every application it will collect the load script, variables, master
dimensions and measurements and the sheets. For every sheet child objects
are collected.
Collected information is stored in directory structure for the application.

git_processing then checks for changes, commits and push the changes 
to the repository.

The process can run unattended daily to ensure all changes
are collected on a regular base.

Environment settings are defined in .env in the application root directory.

    # Main
    LOGDIR = <your log directory>
    LOGLEVEL = <log level: info, debug, warning>

    # Local Config
    LOCAL_WORKDIR = <directory to repository for local QS Engine>
    LOCAL_URI = ws://localhost:4848/app/

    # Remote Config
    REMOTE_WORKDIR = <directory to repository for remote QS Engine>
    REMOTE_URI = <URI of your remote QS Engine>
    CERT_DIR = <your local certificate store directory>
    USERDIRECTORY = <QS User Directory Name>
    USERID = <QS UserID>
    SERVERNODEID = <QS Server Node ID>

The QS server needs to be resolvable. It can be in the /etc/hosts file.
